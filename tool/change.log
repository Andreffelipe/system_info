0.0.1 Initial release
0.0.3 Changed the algorithm for detecting the number of physical processor sockets on Windows
0.0.4 Fixed a bug when parsing comments in the file `/boot/config` on Linux
0.0.5 Partial support of `phycical memory` and `virtual memory` statistics
0.0.6 Renamed method `physicalMemoryFreeSize()` to `getFreePhysicalMemory()`
0.0.6 Renamed method `physicalMemoryTotalSize()` to `getTotalPhysicalMemory()`
0.0.6 Renamed method `virtualMemoryFreeSize()` to `getFreeVirtualMemory()`
0.0.6 Renamed method `virtualMemoryTotalSize()` to `getTotalVirtualMemory()`
0.0.7 Partial support of `processor architecture` statistics
0.0.8 Detection of `bitness of kernel` on Linux are based on the found file formats of `libc.so.*`
0.0.9 Fixed bug in detection of `bitness of kernel` on Linux
0.0.10 Implemented `getFreePhysicalMemory()` and `getTotalVirtualMemory()` on Mac OS X.
0.0.11 Fixed bug in detection of `kernel architecture` on Windows. More universal algorithm independent from the architecture name, allows detect any architecture (X86/ AMD64/ IA64/ etc)
